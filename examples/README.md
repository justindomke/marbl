Examples
=====

Going through these examples is probably the fastest way to understand how to use Marbl.

# Pure inference in MRF models

## Single-node inference

This is explained in the [single-node inference](singlenode_inference.md) example

## Chain graph inference

This is explained in the [chain inference](chain_inference.md) example

# Logistic Regression

The first learning example consists of learning a model with a single output variable, which is equivalent to learning a standard (multivariate, non-structured) logistic regression model.  This is explained in the [logistic regression](logistic_regression.md) example.
