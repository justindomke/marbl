Examples
=====

Going through these examples is probably the fastest way to understand how to use Marbl.  These are all extremely trivial problems, chosen so that the data formats for inputs and outputs can be shown in full detail.

# Pure inference in MRF models

## Single-node inference

This is explained in the [single-node inference](singlenode_inference.md) example

## Chain graph inference

This is explained in the [chain inference](chain_inference.md) example

# Logistic Regression

The first learning example consists of learning a model with a single output variable, which is equivalent to learning a standard (multivariate, non-structured) logistic regression model.  This is explained in the [logistic regression](logistic_regression.md) example.

There is also an example of how to do [logistic regression using MPI](logistic_regression_mpi.md)

# Learning chain CRFs

A simple chain CRF with four nodes is learned in (chain learning)[chain_learning.md].
